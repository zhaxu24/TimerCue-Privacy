# Privacy Policy

*Last Updated: January 2025*

## Introduction

WorkTimer is a privacy-focused, offline time tracking application. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data handling and privacy protection.

## Our Privacy Commitment

WorkTimer is designed to be completely offline and privacy-first. We have intentionally designed the app to:
- Store all data locally on your device only
- Operate completely offline
- Not collect or transmit any data

## Data Storage and Usage

### Local Storage Only
- All data is stored exclusively on your device
- No cloud storage or synchronization
- No internet connection required

### What Data is Stored Locally
The App only stores:
- Your time entries
- App preferences
- Display settings

All of this data remains on your device and is never transmitted elsewhere.

### Data Export
- CSV export is available only when you explicitly choose to export
- Export function is entirely user-initiated
- Exported data remains under your control

## What We Don't Do

Our app does NOT:
- Collect any personal information
- Use any analytics tools
- Collect crash reports
- Use cloud storage
- Require any special system permissions
- Send push notifications
- Use any third-party services
- Connect to the internet

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally:
- Data security depends on your device's security
- We recommend using your device's built-in security features (passcode, Face ID, etc.)
- Deleting the app will permanently remove all data

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not collect any information from anyone, including children. All data is stored locally on the device.

## Your Rights and Control

You have complete control over your data:
- All data is stored only on your device
- You can export your data at any time
- You can delete all data by deleting the app
- No data recovery is possible after app deletion

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the App Store and updating the "Last updated" date.
